## Description

This CLI application can make a simple webpage that displays some information and links about your employees.

- My motivation for making this application was to learn more about creating dynamic webpages based on user provided information.
- Why did you build this project?
- This solves the problem of time wasted manually creating an information page for employees.
- I learned more about the use of expressions inside of template literals.
